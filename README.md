Project Management and Risk Assessment Tool
A comprehensive construction project management application with integrated risk management, resource allocation, and cost tracking capabilities.
Features
Activity Management
Create and manage project activities with dependencies
Define activity durations and calculate critical path
Track activity progress and status
Resource Management
Organize resources in hierarchical breakdown structure
Group resources by categories
Assign resources to activities
Visualize resource breakdown structure (RBS)
Risk Management
Identify and analyze project risks
Assign risks to specific activities
Visualize risks in risk matrix by probability and impact
Track risk mitigation measures
Cost Management
Create bill of quantities
Link quantities to specific activities
Calculate costs and track budget
Visual Planning Tools
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagram
Gantt chart with critical path highlighting
PERT network diagram
Resource Breakdown Structure visualization
Risk matrix
Integration View for comprehensive relationship management
Development Status
Important Note: This project is currently under active development and not yet ready for production use. The code requires corrections, optimizations, and additional features before it becomes a stable, production-ready open-source program.
Current Limitations and Areas for Improvement
Integration between different components needs enhancement
Some UI elements require refinement
Additional features like reporting and data export are planned but not yet implemented
Code structure could benefit from refactoring in certain areas
Documentation is still a work in progress
Call for Collaboration
We welcome contributors of all skill levels! Whether you're experienced with PyQt5 development, project management principles, or just want to learn and contribute, there's a place for you in this project.
Areas where help is particularly needed:
Bug fixing and code optimization
UI/UX improvements
Feature development (reporting, data import/export, etc.)
Documentation and tutorials
Testing across different platforms
If you're interested in contributing, please check the issues section or feel free to create new issues for features or bugs you identify. Pull requests are highly appreciated!
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
PyQt5
Matplotlib (for charts)
Usage Guide
Creating a Project
Start the application
Add activities in the Activities tab
Define dependencies between activities
Set durations and dates
Managing Resources
Navigate to the Resources tab
Add resources and organize them in groups
Use the RBS visualization to view resource hierarchy
Assign resources to activities in the Integration tab
Risk Assessment
Go to the Risks tab
Add potential project risks with probability and impact ratings
Assign risks to relevant activities
View the risk matrix for a visual representation of project risk exposure
Bill of Quantities
Navigate to the BOQ tab
Add items with descriptions, units, and dimensions
Link BOQ items to activities in the Integration tab
Project Analysis
View the Gantt chart to see the timeline and critical path
Examine the PERT chart to understand activity dependencies
Use the Integration View to manage relationships between activities, resources, risks, and BOQ items
Roadmap
Future plans for this project include:
Enhanced reporting capabilities
Data import/export with common project management formats
Resource leveling algorithms
Monte Carlo simulation for risk analysis
Mobile companion app
Cloud synchronization
Contributing
Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! Let's build this tool together into a robust, free, and open-source alternative to commercial project management software.
